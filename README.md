# Introduction 
ETicket WEB applications
ETicket - a system for paying for public transport, taking into account privileges for passengers. It provides the introduction of a single ticket for any type of transport with transfers within the validity of the ticket.
The system provides financial transparency and displays metrics. Admin/moderator team can manage data using MVC Admin website. Many other clients (mobile, website, verificator, application) can use RESTfull API to get some info about tickets, prices, users and so on.
Project consists of several modules: MVC Admin, REST Web Api, Services, DataAccess Layer, Mobile Client (Xamarin).
Our project is winner of the SoftServe OpenNight in May 2020.
